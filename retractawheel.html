                This project was developed as part of my first-year design class, focusing on creating a practical solution for an individual recovering from a stroke. Working directly with a client who faced specific mobility challenges, our team designed an adaptive cycling aid that promotes independence while providing necessary support. Through user research, iterative prototyping, and continuous feedback, we developed retractable training wheels that offer balance assistance during the most challenging phase of cycling while allowing for normal riding once in motion.

            <p>
                Our team was connected with Ms. Paula Redmond, who was recovering from a recent stroke. While she had made progress in her recovery, she specifically struggled with riding her bicycle independently. She approached our team to design a solution that would address this limitation while preserving her autonomy and dignity.

            <p>
                We began by conducting interviews with Ms. Redmond to better understand her specific challenges and requirements for the final product. Through direct observation sessions, we discovered a crucial insight: Ms. Redmond was fully capable of maintaining balance and control once she reached cycling speed, but she struggled significantly with initial balance and acceleration.

                To complement our user research, we also investigated:

                <li>The biomechanics of cycling movements</li>
                <li>How strokes affect mobility and balance</li>

                Our team conducted comprehensive brainstorming sessions, documenting every idea regardless of feasibility. We then evaluated these ideas against Ms. Redmond's specific guidelines and needs. The most promising concepts were selected for initial prototyping.

                We created simple low-fidelity prototypes to better visualize and evaluate our concepts. These prototypes were presented to Ms. Redmond for feedback, which helped us narrow down to a single direction. The concept that resonated most with her was our idea for retractable training wheels.

        <div class="WhiteText">
            <p>
                The retractable training wheels concept addressed Ms. Redmond's specific needs by providing stability assistance during the initial balancing and acceleration phasesâ€”precisely when she needed it most. Once she achieved stable momentum, she could retract the wheels, giving her full control and independence during normal riding conditions.

                Taking the concept into physical form, we worked in the shop to develop a high-fidelity prototype using available materials and components ordered online. After many hours of hands-on work, we completed a functional prototype that demonstrated the core mechanics of our solution, which we presented to the class and client.

                This project being one of my first ever design projects reinforced why I love design and taught me important design principles. Even though now as a more experienced designer there is a lot I would do differently, I still proud of the work me and my team did to help Ms. Redmond ride her bike independently.
