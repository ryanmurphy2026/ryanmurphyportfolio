        </h1>
        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                This project, developed as part of my first-year design class at Northwestern, focused on creating a practical solution for an individual recovering from a stroke. Working directly with the individual, who faced specific mobility challenges, our team designed an adaptive cycling aid that provides stability support while promoting independence. Through user research, iterative prototyping, and continuous feedback, we developed retractable training wheels that offer balance assistance during the initial, challenging phase of cycling while allowing for normal riding once in motion.

            <p>
                Our team was connected with Ms. Paula Redmond, a cyclist, who was recovering from a recent stroke. While she showed improvement in her recovery, she specifically struggled with riding her bicycle independently. Ms. Redmond approached our team to design a solution that would address this limitation while preserving her autonomy and dignity.

            <p>
                We began by conducting interviews with Ms. Redmond to better understand her specific challenges and requirements for the final product. Through direct observation sessions, we discovered a crucial insight: Ms. Redmond was fully capable of maintaining balance and control once she reached cycling speed, but she struggled significantly with initial balance and acceleration.

                To complement our user research, we investigated:

            <ul>
                <li>The biomechanics of cycling movements</li>
                <li>How strokes affect mobility and balance</li>
                <li>Current adaptive cycling solutions available on the market</li>

                Our team conducted comprehensive brainstorming sessions, documenting every idea regardless of feasibility. We then evaluated these ideas against Ms. Redmond's specific guidelines and needs. The most promising concepts were selected for initial prototyping.

            <p>
                We created simple low-fidelity prototypes to better visualize and evaluate our concepts. These prototypes were then presented to Ms. Redmond for feedback, helping the team narrow its concepts down to one. The concept of retractable training wheels was the one that resonated most with her.

        <div class="WhiteText">
            <p>
                The concept of retractable training wheels addressed Ms. Redmond's specific needs by providing stability support during the initial balance and acceleration phases - precisely when she needed it most. Once she achieved stable momentum, she could retract the wheels, giving her full control and independence during normal riding conditions.

                To transform the concept into a viable end product, the team utilized the Segal Design Shop to develop a mid-fidelity prototype, using available materials and components. After hours of tactile labor, we completed a functional prototype that demonstrated the core mechanics of our solution, which we then presented to Ms. Redmond for final approval.

                This project represented my first experience with all stages of the design process, teaching me important principles and reinforcing my passion for design. I am particularly proud of the work our team did to help Ms. Redmond ride her bike independently.
