                <p>Overview</p>
                <p id="intro">The project aimed to design a solution for Ms. Paula Redmond, a stroke survivor who struggles with balancing her bike during initial acceleration. The goal was to help her ride independently and confidently without altering her normal biking experience. Our team worked under the guidance of the Design Thinking and Communication Program at Northwestern University.

                <p>Background Research</p>
                <p> We studied the physiology of cycling, the effects of strokes, and existing solutions for balance issues. This helped us understand the muscles involved in cycling, the impact of strokes on balance, and adaptive bike solutions available in the market.</p>

We then made low-fidelity prototypes of our top 3 ideas and then socialized them with Ms. Redmond to see which one she liked best. The retractable training wheels concept was selected for further development due to its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>

                <p>Design Overview</p>
                <p>Retract-A-Wheels are training wheels that stabilize the bike during initial acceleration and retract for normal riding. The design includes stability wheels, a bungee cord to keep the wheels in tension, a spring-loaded pin for locking, and a cable release grip for easy disengagement.</p>
