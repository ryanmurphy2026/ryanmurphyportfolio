                In the summer of 2025, I joined the Lynkr team as a designer. During my tenure there, Lynkr was undergoing a name change to Live Time and a complete rebrand to accompany it. My responsibility was to lead the rebrand and update all the screens accordingly.
            </p>  
            <p>
                An entire brand book and design system was developed.

        <h1 class="PinkTitle">Colors</h1>
        <div class="WhiteText">
            <p>
                One of the main goals of the rebrand was to maintain the fun of the original while modernizing its appearance. Live Time's primary brand color is pink, which was used throughout the old version of the app. However, we received feedback from users that the pink previously used made the app feel 'too girly'. I wanted to keep pink in Live Time's branding as it is a distinctive color that isn't often used in branding, which would help us stand out from the crowd. However, I wanted to update it to something that felt modern and more gender-neutral. After examining various pinks for several hours, I landed on the final pink shown below. I then complemented our pink with a custom black and white to finalize Live Time's primary colors. These colors were tested with accessibility checkers to ensure readability for all users. I then developed a lighter shade of our pink and two grays to add tonal variety to the color palette.

                After finalizing the main colors, I developed four secondary colors and their lighter versions to provide flexibility in color usage

                With the rebrand came the selection of new fonts. To maintain the sleek but fun theme, I chose Rockhill Sans as our display font since it is clean while still having personality. This font would be primarily used for branding materials and display text within the app. I then chose Hanken Grotesk as our primary font for all important information in the app to ensure everything is easy to read and understand.

            <p>
                For the new logo, we wanted to keep the flamingo motif but simplify it for our new modern branding, as the original was too complex. The new logo was first designed on paper and then transferred to Adobe Illustrator. The new logo uses simple lines, which allows it to be used in a variety of ways. It is also easy to draw from memory, demonstrating that it is both recognizable and memorable.

                The new branding meant a complete overhaul of every screen in the app. The goal was to simplify everything and create a clean interface similar to apps like Airbnb. This process started with greyboxing a lo-fi version of the app in Figma to work on user flows and layouts. Once those were finalized, we transitioned to a hi-fi prototype with the new updated branding. By the end, we had created over 150 different screens for the app.
