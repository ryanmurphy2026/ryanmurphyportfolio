        <h1 class="GreenTitle" id="Name">Amazon Music Social Redesign: Turning Streaming into Communityy</h1>
        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                As part of Northwesternâ€™s Bay Area Immersion Program, our team collaborated with Amazon Music on a 10-week design practicum focused on disrupting their platform to develop innovative ideas for future use. Our challenge was clear: help Amazon Music better attract and retain Gen Z users, particularly in comparison to competitors like Spotify.
            </p>  
        </div>  
    </div>

    <div class="GreenBackground" id="Opportunity">
        <h1 class="PinkTitle">Identifying the Opportunity</h1>
        <div class="WhiteText">
            <p>
                Our team quickly recognized that Amazon Music lacked the social components that make music inherently communal. This inspired our core mission: transform Amazon Music from a simple streaming service into a vibrant social music playground that fosters community and connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                We framed our approach with two key questions:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><i>How might we turn Amazon Music into a social music playground to encourage fan-to-fan activity?</i></li>
                <li><i>How might we transform Amazon Music into more than just a streaming platform?</i></li>
            </ul>
        </div>  
    </div>

    <div class="WhiteBackground" id="User Research">

        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                To ground our work in real user needs, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with college students aged 18-22. An overwhelming 85% reported regularly sharing music with others, uncovering a profound insight: for young people, music sharing isn't just a feature - it's an essential way to connect, bond, and express themselves.
            </p>  
            <p>
                <strong>Key User Insights</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>"I was able to make a new friend from posting my music on Instagram."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Music is representative of your personality, so connecting with people through your music taste is validating."</i></li>
                <li><i>"I feel good about myself when I share a song and they say they like it."</i></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>User Personas</strong></p>
            <p>Our research led to the development of two distinct personas:</p>

            <p><i>Lurking Louise</i></p>
            <p>Louise enjoys her personal music library but sometimes finds it repetitive. She turns to platforms like Spotify and Instagram to passively discover new music by exploring what friends are listening to and sharing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary Goal: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>See what her friends are listening to without necessarily sharing her own music preferences</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><i>Social Sally</i></p>
            <p>Sally is passionate about sharing music. She's always first to post comments about new releases from her favorite artists via Instagram. She sees music as a crucial way to express herself and connect with others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary Goal: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Share her music taste as a form of self-expression</li>
                        <li>Form new connections through shared musical interests</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                We designed a system of badges and customizable profile pages to add personalization to Amazon Music, transforming it into another form of self-expression:

                <li>Democratize queue system to ensure everyone's selections are played</li>
                <li>AI-powered song suggestions based on everyone's music taste when selections run low</li>

                A centralized sandbox within Amazon Music that:

            <ul>
                <li>Experiments with various digital experiences and live events</li>
                <li>Takes a playful approach to connecting individuals through music-related activities</li>

            <p>After 10 weeks of in-depth research, brainstorming, and prototyping, we presented our ideas directly to the Amazon Music team at their San Francisco headquarters. Our goal was to inspire potential implementation and spark new directions for the platform's future.</p>

            <p>
                This project reinforced the value of keeping the design process playful and engaging. Whether developing inherently fun concepts or bringing them to life through mini skits and personal anecdotes, embracing a sense of joy and creativity was essential to our success. I learned that truly enjoying the process - and fostering a dynamic collaboration with the company - is the best way to stay energized, inspired, and innovative throughout the design journey.
