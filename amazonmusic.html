        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                During the Northwestern Bay Area Immersion Program, I collaborated with Amazon Music on a 10-week design practicum focused on disrupting their platform and developing innovative ideas for the future. Our challenge was clear: help Amazon Music better attract and retain Gen Z users, particularly compared to competitors like Spotify.

        <div class="WhiteText">
            <p>
                Our team quickly recognized that Amazon Music lacked the social components that make music inherently communal. This inspired our core mission: transform Amazon Music from a simple streaming service into a vibrant social music playground that fosters community and connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                We framed our approach with two key questions:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li>How might we turn Amazon Music into a social music playground to encourage fan-to-fan activity?</li>
                <li>How might we transform Amazon Music into more than just a streaming platform that builds community?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To ground our work in real user needs, we conducted 20 interviews with college students. A striking 85% reported regularly sharing music with others. These conversations revealed something profound: for young people, music sharing isn't merely a featureâ€”it's a fundamental means of connection, bonding, and self-expression.

                <li><i>"Music is representative of your personality, so connecting with people through your music taste is validating."</i></li>

                Our research led to the development of two distinct personas:
            </p>  
            <p>Lurking Louise</p>
            <p>Louise enjoys her personal music library but sometimes finds it repetitive. She turns to platforms like Spotify and Instagram to passively discover new music by exploring what friends are listening to and sharing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary Goal: To see what her friends are listening to without necessarily sharing her own preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Social Sally</p>
            <p>Sally is passionate about sharing music. She's always first to post about new releases from her favorite artists on Instagram. She sees music as a crucial way to connect with others and express herself.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary Goals: Share her music taste as a form of self-expression and form new connections through shared musical interests</li>

                We designed a system of badges and alternate profile pages to add personalization to Amazon Music, transforming it into another form of self-expression:

                After 10 weeks of in-depth research, brainstorming, and prototyping, we presented our ideas directly to the Amazon Music team at their San Francisco headquarters. Our goal was to inspire potential implementation and spark new directions for the platform's future.

            <p>
                This project taught me the importance of keeping the design process playful and enjoyable. Whether executing ideas through mini skits and personal anecdotes or creating inherently fun concepts, embracing that spirit was key to our success. I discovered that enjoying both the process and collaborating with the company is the best way to stay energized and inspired throughout the design journey.
