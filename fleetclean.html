        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                During my internship at Allvan, a Tennessee-based trucking company specializing in van body manufacturing, I was tasked with developing the initial prototype for a new business partnership. Allvan had recently secured a contract with a new client to supply van bodies—the cargo compartments mounted on truck chassis—and needed a compelling prototype to launch the relationship.

                To ensure the design would meet all client requirements, I led a comprehensive on-site discovery process:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Site Visit & Documentation</strong>: Together with the help from my colleagues, I conducted an extensive site visit to the client's facility where we:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Took detailed measurements of existing structures and mounting points</li>
                        <li>Captured comprehensive photography for reference</li>
                        <li>Documented specific operational requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Consultation</strong>: I engaged directly with the client's owner to understand:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Critical design constraints</li>
                        <li>Operational priorities</li>
                        <li>Industry-specific requirements</li>
                        <li>Performance expectations</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                With a thorough understanding of the client's needs, I began the design process:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reference Analysis</strong>: Studied blueprints of existing van bodies to understand industry standards and best practices</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Consultation</strong>: I engaged directly with the client's owner to understand:</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong>: Developed comprehensive technical specifications to ensure manufacturing feasibility</li>
            </ul>

            <img id="VanPhoto" src="Fleet Photos/fleet clean design 2.JPG" width="100%">
            <p>
                The initial prototype underwent several rounds of review and refinement:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engineering Review</strong>: Received technical feedback from Allvan's head engineer regarding structural integrity and manufacturing approach</li>
                <li><strong>Supervisory Input</strong>: Incorporated guidance from my direct supervisor on company standards and production capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Client Validation</strong>: Presented iterations to the client owner to ensure the design aligned with their operational needs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                What made this project particularly significant was its direct path to production. Rather than being merely a conceptual exercise, my prototype was designated to serve as the foundation for the actual production model. This real-world implementation of my work represented an exceptional level of trust and validation from both Allvan and their client.

                This project provided invaluable experience in translating client requirements into technical solutions while navigating the constraints of manufacturing processes. Working across organizational boundaries and incorporating feedback from multiple stakeholders enhanced my ability to develop designs that balance innovation with practicality.
