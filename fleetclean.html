        <div class="BlackText">
            <p>
                During my internship at Allvan, a Tennessee-based trucking company specializing in van body manufacturing, I was tasked with developing the initial prototype for a new business partnership. Allvan had recently secured a contract with a new client to supply van bodies - the cargo compartments mounted on truck chassis - and required a compelling prototype to launch the relationship.

                To ensure the design would meet all client requirements, I led a comprehensive on-site discovery process:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Site Visit & Documentation</strong>: Together with several colleagues, I conducted an extensive site visit to the client's facility where we:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Took detailed measurements of existing structures and mounting points</li>
                        <li>Captured comprehensive photography for reference</li>
                        <li>Documented specific operational requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Consultation</strong>: I engaged directly with the client to understand:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Critical design constraints</li>
                        <li>Operational priorities</li>
                        <li>Industry-specific requirements</li>
                        <li>Performance expectations</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                With a thorough understanding of the client's needs, I began the design process:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reference Analysis</strong>: Studied blueprints of existing van bodies to understand industry standards and best practices</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Prototyping</strong>: Converted field measurements and requirements into a detailed 3D model using Autodesk Inventor</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong>: Developed comprehensive technical specifications to ensure manufacturing feasibility</li>
            </ul>

            <img id="VanPhoto" src="Fleet Photos/fleet clean design 2.JPG" width="100%">
            <p>
                The initial prototype underwent several rounds of review and refinement:
            </p>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engineering Review</strong>: Received technical feedback from Allvan's head engineer regarding structural integrity and manufacturing approach</li>
                <li><strong>Supervisory Input</strong>: Incorporated guidance from my direct supervisor on company standards and production capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Client Validation</strong>: Presented iterations to the client to ensure the design aligned with their operational needs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <p>
                This project provided invaluable experience in transforming client requirements into practical technical solutions while navigating manufacturing constraints. Collaborating across organizational boundaries and integrating feedback from diverse stakeholders strengthened my ability to develop a design that balances innovation with practicality. Furthermore, seeing my design brought to life in a real-world application was both a testament to the trust placed in me by Allvan and the client and a deeply validating professional milestone.
