                This project, developed as part of Northwestern's Human-Centered Product Design course, addressed the critical safety and accessibility challenges homeowners and professional services face when cleaning second-story gutters. With a multidisciplinary team, I led the development of an innovative spring-loaded mesh guard system that enables safe, efficient gutter maintenance from the ground level. Through comprehensive user research, iterative prototyping, and rigorous testing, we created a solution that eliminates the need for dangerous ladder climbing while providing superior cleaning performance and real-time gutter visibility.

                Our team identified a significant white space opportunity in home maintenance: over 50,000 Americans are injured annually in ladder-related accidents with gutter cleaning representing a primary cause. We connected with California homeowners facing dual challenges:  clogged gutters posing serious fire risks in drought-prone regions and insurance companies using drones to inspect and monitor gutter maintenance, potentially canceling coverage for debris accumulation. Professional services often refuse second-story work due to liability concerns, leaving homeowners with dangerous DIY solutions or expensive alternatives.

            <p>
                We conducted in-depth interviews with homeowners and professional services to understand the complete ecosystem of challenges. Through direct observation and journey mapping, we discovered that existing solutions (extended pressure washers, telescoping brushes, and static mesh guards) consistently failed to meet user needs for safety, reach, visibility, and effectiveness.
            </p>  
            <p>Key insights from our research included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homeowners avoid second-story gutter cleaning due to safety fears and equipment limitations</li>
                <li>Professional services charge $400-$700 but often refuse multi-story jobs</li>
                <li>Existing products lack visibility into gutters and require impractical strength to operate</li>
                <li>Water-intensive solutions are unsuitable for drought-prone, fire-risk areas</li>

                Through comprehensive brainstorming, our team generated six distinct solution categories: extendable poles, drones, retractable scrapers, remote-controlled cars, emptiable baskets, and window-based tools. Using systematic alternative matrices, we evaluated each concept against critical performance requirements - safety, reach, visibility, cleaning effectiveness, and ease of use. The emptiable mesh basket concept emerged as the most promising solution.

            <p><strong>First Prototype:</strong></p>

                Our final design combines three integrated components: spring-loaded mesh guard that flips downward to release debris, a ground-level pull-string system with ergonomic handle, and a solar-powered inspection camera with mobile app connectivity. The modular system, installed across entire gutter lengths, enables users to clean accumulated debris in seconds through simple pull-and-release action.
