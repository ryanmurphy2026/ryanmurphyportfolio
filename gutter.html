                During my first-year design class at Northwestern, our team was given creative freedom to address a real-world problem that personally resonated with us. The timing was serendipitous - Chicago was experiencing particularly rainy weeks, and as any local knows, Chicago's notorious winds create a perfect storm for umbrella failure. Our team repeatedly faced the frustration of umbrellas inverting during rainstorms, leaving us soaked despite our best efforts at protection.

                Our team identified a significant white space opportunity in home maintenance: over 50,000 Americans are injured annually in ladder-related accidents, with gutter cleaning being a primary cause. We connected with California homeowners facing dual challenges—clogged gutters pose serious fire risks in drought-prone regions, while insurance companies now use drone inspections to monitor gutter maintenance, potentially canceling coverage for debris accumulation. Professional services often refuse second-story work due to liability concerns, leaving homeowners with dangerous DIY solutions or expensive alternatives.

                We conducted in-depth interviews with homeowners and professional gutter cleaning services to understand the complete ecosystem of challenges. Through direct observation and journey mapping, we discovered that existing solutions—extended pressure washers, telescoping brushes, and static mesh guards—consistently failed to meet user needs for safety, reach, visibility, and effectiveness.
            </p>  
            <p>Key insights from our research included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homeowners avoid second-story gutter cleaning due to safety fears and equipment limitations</li>
                <li>Professional services charge $400-700 but often refuse multi-story jobs</li>
                <li>Existing products lack visibility into gutters and require impractical strength to operate</li>
                <li>Water-intensive solutions are unsuitable for drought-prone, fire-risk areas</li>

                Our team generated six distinct solution categories through comprehensive brainstorming: extendable poles, drones, retractable scrapers, remote-controlled cars, emptiable baskets, and window-based tools. Using systematic alternatives matrices, we evaluated each concept against critical performance requirements including safety, reach, visibility, cleaning effectiveness, and ease of use. The emptiable mesh basket concept emerged as the most promising solution.

                We developed three successive prototypes, each incorporating user feedback and performance improvements:
            </p>  
            <p><strong>First Prototype:</strong></p>
            <p>Ground-level proof-of-concept that validated debris removal but lacked automatic reset functionality </p>
            <p><strong>Second Prototype:</strong></p>
            <p>Added spring-loaded mechanism for automatic mesh guard return and conducted elevated testing on Northwestern's Ford balcony, achieving 96.3% debris removal with dry materials.</p>
            <p><strong>Final Prototype:</strong></p>
            <p>Scaled to full 10-foot gutter length with enhanced string durability and ergonomic handle, tested with both wet and dry debris to simulate real-world conditions.</p>

                We conducted comprehensive functional and user testing across two iterations with 10+ participants. Our solution achieved:
            </p>     
            <ul>
                <li>96% debris removal efficiency (dry conditions) and 72% (wet conditions)</li>
                <li>Cleaning time reduction from hours to under 30 seconds</li>
                <li>4.6/5 user satisfaction rating for ease of use</li>
                <li>1.6/5 frustration score (significantly below marginal specification)</li>
                <li>Successful operation at realistic second-story heights</li>

                This project exemplified human-centered design principles while addressing a genuine safety crisis. I'm particularly proud of our team's commitment to ethical engineering—prioritizing user safety, environmental sustainability, and accessibility throughout the design process. The experience reinforced my passion for creating solutions that meaningfully improve people's daily lives while tackling complex, multifaceted challenges.
